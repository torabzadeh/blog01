## No.1: Spectra for different tree leaves 
This dataset includes lab spectrometry data of collected green leaves/niedles of five tree species, catched from USGS spectral library [USGS](https://crustal.usgs.gov/speclab/QueryAll07a.php).
The species are listed here:

- Blue Spruce needles 
- Maple Leaves

## No.2: Spectra for a leaf with different water content
This dataset includes lab spectrometry data of a plant leaf with six different water content, catched from USGS spectral library [USGS](https://crustal.usgs.gov/speclab/QueryAll07a.php).

the water content changes from 60% to 10%.
