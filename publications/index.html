In this aspect, variation in vegetation covers is one of the most critical issues affecting global energy balance. The present study is conducted to examine the relationship between changes in vegetation cover (by using NDVI and EVI indices) and changes in surface albedo. Using qualified MODIS data, mean annual albedo variations (during the growing season) and their relation with the changes in NDVI and EVI values in 6 climate zones are investigated for the period of 2004 to 2016. The results show that the lowest variations of albedo are observed in the region with SH-C-VW climate and the highest in the SA-C-W climate. With the exception of A-C-W and SA-C-W climates, the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient between albedo and EVI is stronger than NDVI. Hot spots of temperature and precipitation are detected by employing daily measurements of 17 weather stations to find the relationship with the changes in surface albedo. According to the results, surface albedo has increased during the study period in majority of the weather sites. Generally, increase in surface albedo was evident for 61% of the study area, while decreases were detected in 30% and no significant changes in the remaining areas. Also, except for SH-C-VW climate, albedo has experienced an increasing trend in all climates from April to September. The major albedo declines are found in the Hyrcanian forests, where higher vegetation cover is confirmed by Iran Forests, Range and Watershed Management National Organization. Examining the hot spots in temperature and precipitation reveals that the reduction of albedo (due to the increase in vegetation cover) in the areas coincides with more rainfall in the region. In contrast, higher temperatures were observed for areas with the decreased vegetation cover.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2019</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="torabzadeh2019tree" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Tree species classification in a temperate mixed forest using a combination of imaging spectroscopy and airborne laser scanning</div> <div class="author"> Hossein Torabzadeh, Reik Leiterer, Andreas Hueni, Michael E Schaepman, and Felix Morsdorf </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Agricultural and Forest Meteorology</em> <b>279</b>, 107744 (2019) </div> <div class="links"> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="TORABZADEH2019107744" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Tree species classification in a temperate mixed forest using a combination of imaging spectroscopy and airborne laser scanning</div> <div class="author"> Hossein Torabzadeh, Reik Leiterer, Andreas Hueni, Michael E.

In this study, we fused imaging spectroscopy (IS) data with leaf-on and off small-footprint airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, for tree species identification in a dense temperate forest in Switzerland. In addition to the spectral reflectance of the sunlit part of the tree crowns, structural features computed based on the height, intensity and point distribution of ALS data in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions are used as features. Features were extracted using a pixel-based (1 m × 1 m) and an individual tree crown approach. In addition, applying a floating forward feature selection approach revealed that the ALS-derived features provided relevant structural information for species identification, while IS-derived features added complementary biochemical information. Comparing the accuracies of three different combinations of ALS and IS data, shows the highest classification accuracy (kappa = 90.3%) was obtained by fusing a selected set of features at individual tree crowns (ITC), while the best kappa accuracies resulting from IS or ALS data alone were 74.7% and 75.1%, respectively. Inclusion of the ITC information improved the classification results for all datasets, however, this improvement is significantly higher for ALS derived datasets (+31%). Our results show that accurate ITC information drastically improves classification accuracy of tree species in dense forests and that multi-seasonal ALS structural attributes play a major part in species discrimination.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-1059-2019" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">ESTIMATING ABOVEGROUND BIOMASS IN ZAGROS FOREST, IRAN, USING SENTINEL-2 DATA</div> <div class="author"> Hossein Torabzadeh, Moslem Moradi, and Parviz Fatehi </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences</em> <b>XLII-4/W18</b>, 1059–1063 (2019) </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-1059-2019" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a>] </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-1059-2019"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-1059-2019" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Accurate and reliable assessment of above-ground biomass (AGB) is important for the sustainable forest management, especially in Zagros forests, in which a frangible forest ecosystem is being threatened by anthropogenic factors as well as climate change effects. This study presents a new method for AGB estimation and demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data as an alternative to other costly remotely sensed data, such as hyperspectral and LiDAR data in unapproachable regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a forest in Kurdistan province, west of Iran, using in-situ measured AGB as a dependent variable and spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm. The influence of the input variables number on AGB prediction was also investigated. The model using all spectral bands plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better AGB estimates (R2 = 0.87 and RMSE = 10.75 t ha−1). Including the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but slightly reduced the error. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in different topographical conditions with an advanced machine learning algorithm. However, assessing its transferability to other forest types with varying conditions would enable future performance and interpretability assessments of Sentinel-2.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2016</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="7493651" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">International Benchmarking of the Individual Tree Detection Methods for Modeling 3-D Canopy Structure for Silviculture and Forest Ecology Using Airborne Laser Scanning</div> <div class="author"> Yunsheng Wang, Juha Hyyppä, Xinlian Liang, Harri Kaartinen, Xiaowei Yu, Eva Lindberg, Johan Holmgren, Yuchu Qin, Clément Mallet, António Ferraz, Hossein Torabzadeh, Felix Morsdorf, Lingli Zhu, Jingbin Liu, and Petteri Alho </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</em> <b>54</b>, 5011-5027 (2016) </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2543225" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a>] </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1109/TGRS.2016.2543225"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1109/TGRS.2016.2543225" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Canopy structure plays an essential role in biophysical activities in forest environments. However, quantitative descriptions of a 3-D canopy structure are extremely difficult because of the complexity and heterogeneity of forest systems. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides an opportunity to automatically measure a 3-D canopy structure in large areas. Compared with other point cloud technologies such as the image-based Structure from Motion, the power of ALS lies in its ability to penetrate canopies and depict subordinate trees. However, such capabilities have been poorly explored so far. In this paper, the potential of ALS-based approaches in depicting a 3-D canopy structure is explored in detail through an international benchmarking of five recently developed ALS-based individual tree detection (ITD) methods. For the first time, the results of the ITD methods are evaluated for each of four crown classes, i.e., dominant, codominant, intermediate, and suppressed trees, which provides insight toward understanding the current status of depicting a 3-D canopy structure using ITD methods, particularly with respect to their performances, potential, and challenges. This benchmarking study revealed that the canopy structure plays a considerable role in the detection accuracy of ITD methods, and its influence is even greater than that of the tree species as well as the species composition in a stand. The study also reveals the importance of utilizing the point cloud data for the detection of intermediate and suppressed trees. Different from what has been reported in previous studies, point density was found to be a highly influential factor in the performance of the methods that use point cloud data. Greater efforts should be invested in the point-based or hybrid ITD approaches to model the 3-D canopy structure and to further explore the potential of high-density and multiwavelengths ALS data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2015</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="f6114146" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Towards Automated Characterization of Canopy Layering in Mixed Temperate Forests Using Airborne Laser Scanning</div> <div class="author"> Reik Leiterer, Hossein Torabzadeh, Reinhard Furrer, Michael E.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) provides horizontal and vertical information on canopy structure simultaneously. Existing approaches to assess canopy layering often require prior information about stand characteristics or rely on pre-defined height thresholds. We developed a multi-scale method using ALS data with point densities &gt;10 pts/m2 to determine the number and vertical extent of canopy layers (canopylayer, canopylength), seasonal variations in the topmost canopy layer (canopytype), as well as small-scale heterogeneities in the canopy (canopyheterogeneity). We first tested and developed the method on a small forest patch (800 ha) and afterwards tested transferability and robustness of the method on a larger patch (180,000 ha). We validated the approach using an extensive set of ground data, achieving overall accuracies &gt;77% for canopytype and canopyheterogeneity, and &gt;62% for canopylayer and canopylength. We conclude that our method provides a robust characterization of canopy layering supporting automated canopy structure monitoring.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="7327056" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Optimal structural and spectral features for tree species classification using combined airborne laser scanning and hyperspectral data</div> <div class="author"> H.

Remote sensing can provide information on ecosystem state and functioning and, among others, two remote sensing techniques, airborne laser scanning (ALS) and imaging spectroscopy (IS), have been used to characterize forest ecosystems, both independently and combined in fusion approaches. However, the fusion of these datasetsshould make the best use of the complementarity of both sensors and provide better and more robust vegetation products in forested ecosystems. Similar to other data fusion approaches, satisfying results depend on choosing appropriate fusion levels and methods. In this review paper, we summarize and classify relevant studies that focused on forest characterization using combined ALS and IS data, limited to the last decade. We classified the approaches by fusion level (data or product level) and by choice of methods (physical or empirical methods). Five different categories of products (landcover maps, aboveground biomass, biophysical parameters, gross/net primary productivity and biochemical parameters), have been found as the main aspects of forest ecosystems studied so far. A qualitative accuracy analysis of the products exposed that currently landcover maps are profiting the most from ALS and IS data fusion, while there is room for improvements in respect to the other products, such as biophysical parameters. Only few studies using physical approaches were found, but we expect the use of such approaches will increase with the growing availability of physically based radiative transfer models that can simulate both, ALS and IS data.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="6946660" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Fusing imaging spectrometry and airborne laser scanning data for tree species discrimination</div> <div class="author"> H.

Our results show that the fused tree species map does improve on the single system maps and more accurately provides the distribution and fraction of each tree species within the study area.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="8077630" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">An improved marker selection method for hyperspectral image segmentation and classification</div> <div class="author"> Davood Akbari, Saeid Homayouni, Abdolreza Safari, Safa Khazai, and Hossein Torabzadeh </div> <div class="periodical"> (2014) </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS.2014.8077630" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a>] </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1109/WHISPERS.2014.8077630"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1109/WHISPERS.2014.8077630" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Recently, a new approach for spectral-spatial classification of hyperspectral images has been proposed by Tarabalka et al. This approach is based on the Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF) grown from automatically selected markers by using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification. This paper aims at improving this approach by means of a new method for the selection of markers. This method is a combination of SVM and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network classifiers. In the proposed method, the most reliable pixels, i.e. markers, are extracted from the classification maps and used to build the MSF. Three scenarios are evaluated for the first stage of marker selection: SVM, MPL and combination of SVM and MPL. Experimental results on two benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the classification accuracies compared to the approach based on the SVM classification.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="8077493" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Evaluation of intrinsic dimensionality methods using residual and change-point analyses</div> <div class="author"> Amin Alizadeh Naeini, Saeid Homayouni, Mohammad Saadatseresht, and Hossein Torabzadeh </div> <div class="periodical"> (2014) </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/WHISPERS.2014.8077493" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a>] </div> <div class="badges"> <span class="altmetric-embed" data-hide-no-mentions="true" data-hide-less-than="15" data-badge-type="2" data-badge-popover="right" data-doi="10.1109/WHISPERS.2014.8077493"></span> <span class="__dimensions_badge_embed__" data-doi="10.1109/WHISPERS.2014.8077493" data-hide-zero-citations="true" data-style="small_rectangle" data-legend="hover-right" style="margin-bottom: 3px;"></span> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The number of endmembers (NOE) in hyperspectral imagery plays an important role in image analysis applications such as classification, clustering and unmixing. Over the last years, different algorithms have been proposed to estimate the NOE. Nonetheless, each method depends on its own parameters’ values, and as a result, leads to different values for intrinsic dimensionality (ID). In this study a statistical-based method is proposed to evaluate different results of ID algorithms. In this method, the reasonable candidates of ID are selected using both residual analysis (RA) and Change-Point analysis (CPA). Different values for ID are then compared with these candidates. If these values are equal or close to these candidates they may be considered as the ID. Although the proposed method can be used for every ID method, here, the results of two new methods, namely, SML, and O-GENE-AH algorithms have been investigated on Pavia Center hyperspectral dataset.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2012</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="6350691" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">A voxel-based approach for canopy structure characterization using full-waveform airborne laser scanning</div> <div class="author"> R.

Assessing this structure quantitatively using conventional fieldwork or traditional remote sensing methods is difficult, whereas airborne laser scanning (ALS) systems have proven to be suitable for providing explicit vertical information for large areas. However, most existing ALS based approaches include manual processing steps or need additional data about stand characteristics. To solve these issues, a robust and automatic multi-dimensional clustering method was developed to derive forest canopy structure types (CSTs) based on full-waveform ALS data. The results show that it is possible to develop an automatic, self-sustained and transferable method for: the extraction of CSTs without any previous knowledge about the forest stand; and the extraction of bio-physical parameters based on the resulting CSTs.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2026 Hossein Torabzadeh. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/blog01/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/blog01/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/blog01/assets/js/zoom.js?7b30caa5023af4af8408a472dc4e1ebb"></script> <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.22.1/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js"></script> <script src="/blog01/assets/js/no_defer.js?d633890033921b33e0ceb13d22340a9c"></script> <script defer src="/blog01/assets/js/common.js?acdb9690d7641b2f8d40529018c71a01"></script> <script defer src="/blog01/assets/js/copy_code.js?c9d9dd48933de3831b3ee5ec9c209cac" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
